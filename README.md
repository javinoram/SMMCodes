# Spin models codes
This repository store the different python, julia even rust codes that I use to study different 
spin models that represent some single molecular magnets or spin networks.


In each folder you can find some instructions to use it, so feel free to use all that what find usefull.


For any suggestion, idea (to improve the code's quality) or a nice message just leave an issue or send me an email to javier.norambuenal*sansano.usm.cl (change * to @).
